Let’s be real for a sec. You download a PDF, and **Chrome just opens it straight away**. No asking. No warning. Just vibes.

If you’re someone who actually cares about **privacy**, control, or just doesn’t want Chrome being all _too helpful_, this is annoying AF. Good news though, fixing this is **easy as** 🇳🇿 and takes like **2 minutes max**.

Whether you’re on **phone** or **PC**, I’ve got you sorted. Chalo, let’s go 👇🔥

## Stop Chrome from Auto-Opening PDFs on Your Phone 📱

If you don’t want PDFs popping open automatically after download (low-key sus sometimes 👀), just tweak one setting.

Make sure your Chrome is **updated** first. Old versions can be a bit jugaadu.

### Do this 👇

* Open **Google Chrome** on your phone&#x20;
* Tap the **three dots (⋮)** in the top-right corner&#x20;
* Go to **Settings**&#x20;
* Tap **Downloads**&#x20;
* **Turn OFF** 👉 _Automatically open PDFs_&#x20;

Boom 💥Now PDFs will just download and chill, no auto-opening, no drama.

## Stop Chrome from Auto-Opening PDFs on PC / Laptop 💻

Desktop Chrome is a bit different but still sorted in a few clicks.

### Follow these steps 👇

* Open **Google Chrome** on your PC&#x20;
* Click the **three dots (⋮)** in the top-right&#x20;
* Select **Settings** _(Pro tip: type `chrome://settings` in the address bar, faster, bro)_&#x20;
* Go to **Privacy and Security**&#x20;
* Click **Site Settings**&#x20;
* Scroll down to **Additional content settings**&#x20;
* Click **PDF documents**&#x20;
* Select 👉 **Download PDFs instead of opening them in Chrome**&#x20;

That’s it. Sorted. Proper sorted. 😌👌

***

## What Happens After This? 🤔

From now on:

* Chrome will **only download PDFs**&#x20;
* It won’t auto-open them anymore (privacy = stonks 📈)&#x20;

If you want to open a PDF later:

* Right-click the file&#x20;
* Select **Open with → Google Chrome** or any PDF reader you prefer&#x20;

Full control. No bakwaas. No surprises.

## Final Thoughts 🧠✨

Chrome auto-opening PDFs might seem small, but when you care about **privacy**, **security**, or just want things done _your way_, this setting is clutch.
