Renaming photos and videos on iOS is a proper pain. You can edit, crop, filter, and flex. But file names. Nah. Apple said no. If you ever tried to organize media on your iPhone, you already know the struggle.

Most people end up doing some wild workaround. Upload to Dropbox. Rename there. Download again. It works, but it is cooked. Too many steps. Too much effort. Big headache 😤

So I built a fix.

This is a simple how to guide on using my iOS Shortcut called Rename iOS Media. It lets you rename photos and videos directly from your iPhone. No apps. No cloud uploads. All on device. Easy as.

Step one: Install the Shortcut ⚡
Head to this link and add the Shortcut to your Shortcuts app.

Once installed, you are sweet. You only need to do this once.

Step two: Run the Shortcut "Rename iOS Media". Initially, there might be some steps. Just tap Allow Always button.

Step three: Tap on "Select Media" and Select the photo or video you want to rename. This works for both images and videos. Old ones. New ones. All good.

Step four: The Shortcut will ask you for a new file name. Type it in. Hit done.

That is it. No drama. No mucking around.

Your media gets saved back with the new name. Clean. Simple. Job done ✅

This is not something you run every day. But when you need it, it hits different. Perfect for sorting travel photos, renaming videos before editing, or cleaning files before sending them to someone. That moment when you think, why is this so hard. Sorted.

From a tech point of view, everything runs locally. Your files do not leave your phone. No sketchy permissions. No random apps asking for access. Safe as.

Bonus. Language support 🌍 The Shortcut supports multiple languages. Russian language support is provided by @DevilMachine and the Russian community. Proper legend behaviour 🇷🇺. Hindi also available.

Apple might fix this one day. Until then, this Shortcut gets it done. Simple solution. Built for real use. Too easy mate. 🤙
