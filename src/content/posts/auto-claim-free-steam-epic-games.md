Tired of those weekly free game drops on Steam and Epic slipping through your fingers? Yaar, same. I’m chilling in Auckland, grinding work and games, but who has time to check stores every bloody Thursday or those special weeks? Nah, not this Kiwi desi gamer.

Enter this absolute gem of a browser extension: Free Game Claimer for Steam & Epic. It’s like having a cheeky little bot mate who snags the loot while you sip flat whites or smash butter chicken. 😎🍛

I stumbled on it via Reddit, right? Dev dropped the GitHub link, and I was like, “Sweet as, open source? Bet.” Installed in two secs, pinned it to my toolbar. Boom.

First run, it auto-opens the pages, clicks those claim buttons with a human-like delay (no sus bot vibes), and voila, freebies in my library. No cap, I’ve stacked like 55+ games already without lifting a finger 8 weeks. Think The Outer Worlds, Death Stranding, even some Steam hidden gems. My backlog’s lit now, bro.

Here’s the vibe: Popup’s clean AF, React-powered, shows all current free games with deets. Toggle Steam or Epic, set it to check hourly, daily, or on browser start. Manual claim button if you’re impatient. Works on Firefox too if Chrome’s not your jam. 2K users loving it at 4.3 stars. Fair dinkum reliable, no ads, no drama.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Log into your accounts first before using the extension, then tweak settings, and let it rip.

GitHub’s there if you wanna peek the code or build custom.

Install for

1. [Chromium Browers like Edge, Brave, Chrome, etc.](https://go.hira.im/85v23w)
2. [Firefox Browsers like Mozilla, Librewolf, Zen, etc.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/free-game-claime-steam-epic/)
3. Or, [build yourself](https://github.com/spin311/epic-free-games-claim), bcoz developer is awesome.

Chur to spin311 for this. If you’re a fellow gamer missing freebies, smash that install. Your wallet (and future self) will thank you. What’s your fave free game snag? Drop in comments. Peace out. ✌️🎯
