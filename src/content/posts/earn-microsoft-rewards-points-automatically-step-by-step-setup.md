Alright, confession time. I am lazy, but like the productive kind of lazy 😌 If there is a way to automate something boring and still get rewards, I am 100 percent doing it.

Microsoft Rewards is one of those things. Free points for searching stuff on Bing, clicking a few tiles, pretending you care about quizzes. Cool in theory, painful in practice. So I set it up once and now it just vibes in the background while I live my life.

This is not my extension btw. I did not build it. I am just sharing how I use it because honestly, it slaps.

First things first, the boring but important setup stuff 👇

To get search points, you gotta be logged in properly. No shortcuts here.

1. Log in to Microsoft Rewards using your Microsoft account.
2. Then also log in to your Microsoft account on bing.com (just in case if not).

Yeah, both. Microsoft loves double confirmation, very aunty vibes. Once that is sorted, points actually start tracking properly.

Now for daily set points, this is where people usually mess up and then complain online.

* Enable daily set inside the extension settings.
* Allow popups for rewards.bing.

I know popups sound scary, but trust me, this one is necessary. No popup, no points. Although it usually open new tab but still makesure you allow it.

For mobile points, You can download the official Microsoft Rewards Android app.

Now the fun part. The automation. What this extension basically does is open random Bing tabs, let them load, then close them. That is it. No hacking, no shady stuff, just automated boredom. You can control everything, which I love.

* You can choose how many searches it does.
* You can set the time gap between tabs opening in seconds.
* You can even set it to 0 seconds if you want chaos and all tabs at once.
* You can choose how long before each tab closes, or set it to close as soon as it loads.

My personal setup is chill. Not too aggressive, not too slow. Feels human enough so Bing does not get suspicious like bro why are you searching so fast.

The best part, it automatically opens tabs every day when you open your browser. This is on by default. So I open Chrome or Firefox, go make chai ☕, come back, and boom, points done.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> One important thing that people ignore. Pin the extension. Seriously, just pin it. Makes life easier and you can see when it is doing its thing.

If you want to check it out, here are the official links. No sketchy reuploads.

1. For [Chromium based Browsers](https://go.hira.im/xacwwb), like Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.
2. For [Firefox based Browsers](https://go.hira.im/26x2q7), like Mozilla, Zen, etc.
3. For [Android Devices](https://go.hira.im/e3ahgq)
4. It is Open Source so [codes are available on GitHub](https://go.hira.im/ah85hq).

Real talk. This is not about gaming the system hard. It is about removing friction. I still use Bing normally sometimes. I just do not want to manually open 10 random searches every single day like a robot.

Set it once. Forget about it. Let the points stack quietly in the background like passive income but make it Microsoft 😂

If you are already doing Microsoft Rewards and feeling tired, this is a no brainer. If you are not doing it yet, this is the least painful way to start.

Anyway, that is my setup. Works for me here in NZ, works for mates in Aussie, works for my cousin in India too. Absolute win.

Now excuse me while I redeem gift cards and act surprised every time like wow free money 😎
